# Arduino Analog Sensor Reading

This Arduino sketch is designed to read analog sensor data and print it to the Serial Monitor. The code reads the analog signal from pin A0 and continuously prints the sensor readings to the Serial Monitor with a 1-second delay between each reading.

## Components Used

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Analog sensor (connected to analog pin A0)
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Connection

1. Connect the analog sensor (e.g., light sensor, temperature sensor, etc.) to analog pin A0 on the Arduino.
2. Ensure the sensor is powered and properly connected to the ground (GND) and power (5V) as required by the specific sensor.

## Code Explanation

In the `setup` function:
- Serial communication is initialized with a baud rate of 9600 to enable communication with the Serial Monitor.

In the `loop` function:
- The analog reading from pin A0 is obtained using `analogRead(A0)`.
- The obtained reading is printed to the Serial Monitor using `Serial.println()`.
- A delay of 1 second (1000 milliseconds) is added between each reading to control the rate at which data is displayed in the Serial Monitor.

## Usage

1. Upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Ensure the circuit connections are set up correctly, with the analog sensor connected to pin A0.
3. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (Tools -> Serial Monitor) to view the analog sensor readings.
4. Observe the sensor readings in the Serial Monitor, which will update every second.

This example demonstrates how to read and monitor analog sensor data from a connected sensor using an Arduino.
