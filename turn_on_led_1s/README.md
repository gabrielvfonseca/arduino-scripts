# Arduino LED Blinking Example

This Arduino sketch demonstrates the basic functionality of blinking an LED connected to pin 13 on the Arduino board. The LED is turned on for 2 seconds and then turned off for 2 seconds in an endless loop.

## Components Used

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LED (connected to pin 13)
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Connection

1. Connect one leg of the LED to digital pin 13 (LED).
2. Connect the other leg of the LED to the ground (GND).

## Code Explanation

- `LED` is defined as 13, which is the pin to which the LED is connected.

In the `setup` function:
- pinMode is set for `LED` as OUTPUT to control
